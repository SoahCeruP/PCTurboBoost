```To check your PowerShell version:
powershell
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion```

## Installation ⬇️
Clone the repository or download the ZIP file from GitHub:
bash
```git clone https://github.com/chaos2024/PCTurboBoost.git```

Alternatively, download PCTurboBoost.ps1 directly from the Releases page.

***Execution Policy (Optional):***
If your system’s PowerShell execution policy is Restricted, the script will prompt to set it to Bypass for the current user. Alternatively, run this manually:

## Usage
Command Line Options
Run PCTurboBoost.ps1 directly via PowerShell with optional parameters:
powershell
```.\PCTurboBoost.ps1 [-Verbose] [-OutputPath "C:\Path"] [-ConfigFile "custom.json"] [-Portable] [-Silent]```

-Verbose: Display detailed output.
-OutputPath: Specify where logs are saved (default: script directory).
-ConfigFile: Use a custom config file for app removal (default: config.json).
-Portable: Run in portable mode, saving logs to %TEMP%\PCTurboBoost (default: enabled).
-Silent: Automate without prompts (uses defaults).

## Example:
powershell
```.\PCTurboBoost.ps1 -Verbose -Silent

Menu Options
Check PC: View system info and health diagnostics.
Speed Up: Optimize performance settings and services.
Remove Apps: Uninstall specified Windows apps.
Configure Apps: Edit the app removal list.
Repair System: Fix system issues (files, updates, disk).
Exit: Close the script.

### Further Configuration
The script uses a config.json file to manage the list of apps to remove. If it doesn’t exist, a default list is created (non-portable mode only). Edit it manually or use the "Configure Apps" menu option.
Default config.json:
json
```
{
  "AppsToRemove": [
    "Microsoft.SkypeApp", "Microsoft.Teams", "Microsoft.XboxApp", "Microsoft.MixedReality.Portal",
    "Microsoft.GetHelp", "Microsoft.People", "Microsoft.WindowsFeedbackHub", "Microsoft.YourPhone",
    "Microsoft.ZuneMusic", "Microsoft.ZuneVideo", "Microsoft.BingNews", "Microsoft.BingWeather",
    "Microsoft.MicrosoftSolitaireCollection", "Microsoft.3DBuilder", "Microsoft.WindowsMaps",
    "Microsoft.Getstarted", "Microsoft.Messaging", "Microsoft.WindowsCamera"
  ]
}
```

***Output***
Report File: TurboBoost_Report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt (non-portable mode only)
Audit Log: TurboBoost_Audit_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log (detailed actions)
Portable Mode: Logs are saved to %TEMP%\PCTurboBoost.
Safety Notes
Administrative Rights: Required for most changes (handled by RunTurboBoost.bat).
Backups: Registry changes are backed up before optimization (non-portable mode).
Reversible: Most changes can be undone manually (e.g., re-enable services, reinstall apps).
Restart: App removal may require a restart to finalize.
